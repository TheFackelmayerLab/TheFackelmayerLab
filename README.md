Our laboratory is interested in the functional architecture of the cell nucleus as the 
highest level of epigenetic regulation of genome activity. For a start, we here host our version of the
RepEnrich2 software to quantify the transcriptional activity of repetitive elements in the
genome. Please check the additional information and tutorial on how to use the software and,
if necessary, adapt it to different computer setups and/or scientific questions.

Additional software from our lab will be published here later. 

All software and additional material is published here under the MIT license, which basically
means that you can freely use, copy, modify, distribute and sublicense everything you find here,
with the only requirement that you must include the original copyright and license notice in

While all of our material is published under MIT license, we would of course greatly appreciate being mentioned in your papers using our software and/or adapted annotation files. Thank you in advance!
